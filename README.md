# Sensor Tracker

A self-explanatory app that allows you to export sensor data to a Google Sheet. You can control individual sensor tolerances (how much each needs to change before it is uploaded to the Sheet) in the mobile app. The watch app runs in the background but can be stopped by opening it up and clicking the rectangular stop button.
